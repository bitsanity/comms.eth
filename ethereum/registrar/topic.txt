What is a Topic

A topic is a (ensname, address) tuple that is made well-known in the dapp.
Anyone can post to a topic. The app makes it easy to browse and use topics.

No payment of ether is required to register a name. The cost to the user is
merely the cost of gas for the Ethereum transaction.

Creating a topic is payable. This is intended to provide some small deterrent
to abuse.
